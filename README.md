# PacMan in elm

  Repository for PacMan coding-dojo in ELM

## Explanation

The first commit contains skeleton to start.

## Run the test

`elm-test` launch the tests

There are 3 failed tests. Those 3 tests should show 3 different ways we could explore during the dojo :

 * Test *Update when press -> key* : code key event in elm, and update the model depending of the key.
 * Test *Display canvas grid* : code the string transformation to canvas. With this dojo we would like to try canvas display.
 * Test *Display pacman on grid* : more *classical* functionality (for me). Transform complex model into *List Char*

*Helper* :
On my computer the code return by arrows are :

 * → '
 * ← %
 * ↑ &
 * ↓ (

## The result

* launch `elm-reactor`
* Go to http://localhost:8000/src/Main.elm
